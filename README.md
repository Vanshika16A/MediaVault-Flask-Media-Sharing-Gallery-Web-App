# MediaVault
A lightweight web application built using **Python Flask** that allows users to register, log in, upload media (images/videos), browse a gallery, search content, and provides an administrative interface for management and moderation.

This project demonstrates a classic **server-rendered Flask architecture** using HTML templates, static assets (CSS & JS), and backend route handling.
